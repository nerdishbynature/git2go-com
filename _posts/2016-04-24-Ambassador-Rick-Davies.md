I work on Github every day and have developed a small internal app that publishes merged pull requests directly to Shopify. It allows me to develop for Shopify on iOS using Git2Go. This has been my dream forever. Reviewing code from my dev team, merging and publishing from anywhere.

Until I discovered Git2Go I struggled with mobile editors. It's easy to integrate Textastic via the document provider, which lets me make changes effortlessly using an editor that supports over 80 languages. The integration really shines in split view on my iPad Pro as I can commit code without leaving the editor.
