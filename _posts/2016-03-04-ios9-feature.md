Git2Go is built to take advantage of Apple's latest innovations. That's why it fully supports key iOS features like Spotlight search for cloned repositories or Slide Over and Split View.
If you're also rocking a shiny new iPhone, you can easily preview files from your repositories using 3D Touch aka Peek and Pop.
