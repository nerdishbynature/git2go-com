Start adding lines of code during your commute and push them immediately into the branch of your choice, rocking an impressive syntax highlighting engine supporting for JavaScript, Java, Ruby, PHP,
    Python, CSS, C#‚ C, Objective-C, Swift and HTML.

Contributing to your repositories has never been easier without the bloat and complexity of desktop applications.
