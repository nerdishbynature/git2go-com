Seeing your repos is nice, but the real magic starts when you start taking immediate actions from your iOS device.

Git2Go enables you to switch into edit mode for all your files with only performing one tap.

Start adding lines of code during your commute and push them immediately into the branch of your choice, rocking an impressive syntax highlighting engine supporting for JavaScript, Java, Ruby, PHP,
    Python, CSS, C#â€š C, Objective-C, Swift and HTML.

Contributing to your repositories has never been easier without the bloat and complexity of desktop applications.
