Working as a DevOps Engineer, our configuration files are version controlled using Git. They stored on our in-house GitLab Enterprise server. Git2Go allows me to clone those repositories, make any needed changes and push them back up to our configuration management system of choice.

Git2Go allows me to react to changes wherever I am at the moment. Automatic deploys allow me to change server configurations when I am not at my desk.
