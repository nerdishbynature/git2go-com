As a DevOps Engineer, I find it essential to keep all our servers configuration files version controlled using Git and stored on our in-house GitLab Enterprise server. By allowing me to clone those repositories and make any needed alterations, Git2Go has given me the freedom to react to changes wherever I may be at any given moment.

Thanks to Git2Go, gone are the days where I need to be at my desk to change server configurations!
