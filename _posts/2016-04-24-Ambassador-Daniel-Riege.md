Git2Go gives me the opportunity to develop even when I am not at home. I mostly use it to translate my app MyKeychain. Usually this means switching the hardware keyboard on my computer. With my iPad Pro I can use the software keyboard by simply changing the language in the iOS Settings.

Translating my app on the iPad means I can trade time I would waste otherwise for making progress instead. Git2Go supports me doing that by bringing my version control workflow to the iPad.
