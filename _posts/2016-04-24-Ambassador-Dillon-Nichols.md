As an electrical engineer I am working on firmware. During the day I travel to various labs in our building. It is very convenient to have access to my code from anywhere. I use Git2Go to read my current code or go back in time with tags to see if a recent change could be causing the current issue. Using my iOS device is much more convenient and less distracting than using a classic computer.

The built-in Editor and syntax highlighter are making it easy for me to get the current state of the code and debug with the hardware team. Having branches and the full history of the project at my fingertips make spotting changes effortless. I can even draft a small fix right at the spot and finish it on my computer.
