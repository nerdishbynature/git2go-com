Git2Go 1.9 was recently released featuring better support for UTTypes and bundles. Resulting in a better performance and accuracy when using the document provider extension. This adds the possibility to use Swift Playgrounds with Git2Go in iOS 10.


Are you one of the keen ones to jump on the new iOS 10 Public Beta? With the beta you get access to Swift Playgrounds, a new bundled application. The app lets you write and execute Swift code on your iOS device. So you can write an iOS app in an iOS app. Witchcraft, if you ask me. But the best IDE is worthless without some source control. We updated Git2Go to handle bundles and Swift Playgrounds.

To show you how it works we made a small video:

We hope you enjoy it. Help us spread the word on social media!
